<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Chest radiography is the most common imaging examination performed globally, used for screening and diagnosis of many critical illnesses in clinical practice2. The outcomes of radiography inform physicians of a patientâ€™s medical condition, influencing healthcare provided. Typically, medical reports for radiographic images are written manually. This process is tedious and prone to human error. Additionally, because medical report generation requires expert domain knowledge, there is often a shortage of human operators. The generation of medical reports thus represents a bottleneck in patient healthcare. 

Our project aims to tackle the above problems by developing a model for automatic generation of medical X-ray reports. This will reduce load on clinicians and accelerate diagnostic processes. Furthermore, such a model also supports the development of explainable and trustworthy AI, where model outcomes can be explained and are understandable by humans.   


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ChewKinWhye/bioimage-captioning.git
```
2. Create venv
```sh
cd bioimage-captioning
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate 
```
3. Install requirements
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Install Kaggle dataset

Go to the 'Account' tab of your Kaggle user profile (https://www.kaggle.com/<username>/account) and select 'Create API Token'.
Open up downloaded kaggle.json file to obtain username and key.
```sh
export KAGGLE_USERNAME=username
export KAGGLE_KEY=key
kaggle datasets download -d raddar/chest-xrays-indiana-university -p data
unzip chest-xrays-indiana-university.zip
5. Install cheXpert datasta
At the bottom of the CheXpert webpage, write a registration form to download the CheXpert dataset. You will receive an email with the download link. Right-click your mouse on the download link(439GB or 11GB) and click 'Copy link address'
wget -P data -O chexpert "link_address_you_copied"
unzip chexpert
```
